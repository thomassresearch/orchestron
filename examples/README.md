# Examples

This folder contains example exports for Orchestron in two subfolders:

- `instruments/` contains exported instrument files (`*.orch.instrument.json`, `*.orch.instrument.zip`)
- `performances/` contains exported performance files (`*.orch.json`, `*.orch.zip`)

## Import an instrument (Instrument Design -> Import)

1. Open the **Instrument Design** tab.
2. Click **Import**.
3. Select a file from `examples/instruments/`.

## Import a performance (Performance -> Import)

1. Open the **Perform** tab.
2. Click **Import** (in the performance/instrument rack area).
3. Select a file from `examples/performances/`.

During import, the app can also import included patch definitions and handle name conflicts (overwrite, rename, or skip), depending on the export file.
