# Examples

This folder contains example **performance export files** (`*.orch.json`) for Orchestron.

You can import these examples in the app:

1. Open the **Perform** tab.
2. In the **Instrument Rack** section, click **Import**.
3. Select one of the `.orch.json` files from this folder.

During import, the app can also import included patch definitions and handle name conflicts (overwrite, rename, or skip).
