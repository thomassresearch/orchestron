# Performance

This chapter covers the `Perform` page (labeled `Perform` / `Performance` depending language), where you build a playable multi-instrument setup and perform it live.

## What You Can Do Here

- Assemble an instrument rack from saved patches and assign MIDI channels
- Start/stop the instrument engine session
- Create multiple melodic sequencer tracks, drummer sequencers, and controller sequencers
- Use pattern pads with queued switching and pad-loop sequences
- Perform live with piano rolls and manual MIDI controller knobs
- Save/load/clone/delete performances
- Import/export performance bundles (with optional patch definitions)

## Important Concept: Patch vs Performance

- **Patch (Instrument Design page):** one instrument graph
- **Performance (Perform page):** a full live setup that references one or more patches and stores sequencer/piano-roll/controller state

## Practical Workflow

1. Save at least one patch in Instrument Design.
2. Add instruments to the performance rack and assign channels.
3. Start instruments (engine session).
4. Build sequencer tracks / drummer sequencers / controller sequencers / piano rolls.
5. Save the performance.
6. Export the performance bundle for backup or sharing.
